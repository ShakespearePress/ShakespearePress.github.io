            <h2>Charles Palmer</h2>
            <img class="palmer" src="images/charlespalmer.jpg" alt="Portrait of Charles Palmer.">
            <p><b> On November 4, 1896, Charles Leicester Palmer was born in Pigeon, Indiana. </b> He was the first of four children born to Lucy Perkins Boalt Palmer and Asa Gardner Palmer, a &ldquo;railroad man.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>
                While attending San Francisco Polytechnic High School, Palmer acquired the nickname &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo;
                from his passion for writing poetry. In 1918, Palmer joined the U.S. Army Coast Artillery School at Fort Monroe, Virginia.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Palmer returned to California in 1920, he married Helen Olinger. From that year until 1934, he worked in newspaper shops in Northern California, where he gained experience and an appreciation for printing. Palmer worked for the Associated Press, and was also an editor and a journalist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly thereafter, Palmer&#39;s wife died in childbirth, so he and his newborn son moved to Fresno where he worked for the Fresno Bee as a copy editor. He remarried seven years later.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1934, Palmer was hired as an advertising man and publicity writer. Palmer was responsible for traveling to newspapers in California to market the company. In this role, he continued his relationship with newspapers, although now from the opposite side. Whenever he saw a derelict press, Palmer would arrange to buy, trade, or otherwise acquire it, building a collection of presses and type.<b> Over the years he built an impressive collection, eventually naming his hobby press &ldquo;The Shakespeare Press.&rdquo;</b>

                    <p>Known as &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo;
                        to his friends, Mr. Palmer spent his free time from the 1930s to the early 1960s locating and restoring historic pieces of printing equipment. His collection grew and became a historic model of the typefaces, printing presses, and other equipment used by printers of the American West during the late 1800s.</p>

The collection is used as both a museum and a working lab for typography and traditional printing.
