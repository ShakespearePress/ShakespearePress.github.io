              The Shakespeare Press Museum is a 19th century working letterpress
              museum at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. The museum is maintained by
              volunteer student curators who are assisted by a faculty adviser.

              The primary function of the museum is to serve as a repository for
              printing equipment that was used between 1850 and 1920 in
              California. Our collections include many different types of
              printing presses, many different fonts of type, and additional
              equipment and tools that are necessary to staff a printing office.
              In addition to serving as a museum, the Shakespeare Press also
              functions as a letterpress printing office. We believe that
              providing visitors with the opportunity to print provides a link
              to a better understanding of the past. We provide students,
              university staff, and community members with the opportunity to
              learn by doing.

              Since The Shakespeare Press Museum is conveniently located on the
              bottom floor of the Graphic Communication building, many Graphic
              Communication-related clubs, associations, and classes
              consistently take advantage of its equipment. The presses have
              been used to create everything from flyers to club journals.
