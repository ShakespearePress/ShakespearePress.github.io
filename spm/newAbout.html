                The Shakespeare Press Museum is a 19th century working
                letterpress museum at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. The museum is
                maintained by volunteer student curators who are assisted by a
                faculty adviser.

                The primary function of the museum is to serve as a repository
                for printing equipment that was used between 1850 and 1920 in
                California. Our collections include many different types of
                printing presses, many different fonts of type, and additional
                equipment and tools that are necessary to staff a printing
                office. In addition to serving as a museum, the Shakespeare
                Press also functions as a letterpress printing office. We
                believe that providing visitors with the opportunity to print
                provides a link to a better understanding of the past. We
                provide students, university staff, and community members with
                the opportunity to learn by doing.

                Since The Shakespeare Press Museum is conveniently located on
                the bottom floor of the Graphic Communication building, many
                Graphic Communication-related clubs, associations, and classes
                consistently take advantage of its equipment. The presses have
                been used to create everything from flyers to club journals.
